spring-ex15-crud
======================

This example builds on spring-ex14-auth, where we integrated a framework to add unique permissions to all of our controller and service layer methods, and store these permissions in a permissions table in the database.  In this example, we are going to add CRUD functionality to our User table. This example uses Spring 4.0.2 and Spring Security 3.2.3, and uses java configuration files rather than XML.

This example has been validated with the following environment on MS Windows 7:

1. Eclipse Kepler
   1.1 Spring Tool Suite (STS) 3.4.0.RELEASE - for Kepler
2. Java SDK 1.7.0_51 (separate install)
3. Tomcat 7.0.50 (separate install)
4. Maven 3.0.5 (separate install)
5. MySQL 5.5.29
